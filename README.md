# YT-Video-Performance
A data-driven project leveraging the YouTube API to collect and analyze performance metrics for over 200 videos for a channel with over 20,000 subscribers. Delivered actionable insights to the channel owner such as which days to upload and certain keywords in the title in order to optimize viewer engagement.
Built predictive models using Python libraries Scikit-learn (linear regression, random forest) to forecast video view counts based on historical trends, engagement rates, and upload schedules. Employed Pandas for data analysis and Requests library for API integration.
Open to having other analyses on the df
